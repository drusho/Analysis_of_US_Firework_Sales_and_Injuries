NEISS injury data are gathered from the emergency departments (ED) of 96 hospitals selected as a probability sample of all U.S. hospitals with 24-hour EDs and at least 6 inpatient beds. Each participating NEISS hospital is hand-selected by CPSC because it provides an important representation of all other hospitals of its size and unique characteristics in the U.S.
