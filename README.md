#### __About the Data__

<details>
<summary>Data Info</summary>
__1. Source (Injury Data): [Firework Injury Reports](https://www.cpsc.gov/cgibin/NEISSQuery/UserCriteria.aspx?UserAff=5x08cgz9T6YPDAZJzvlZjA%3d%3d&UserAffOther=9OYR9kUytIsLilKZieD5xg%3d%3d)__

Consisted multiple excel incident reports involving fireworks over the past 5 years taken from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).

NEISS injury data are gathered from the emergency departments (ED) of 96 hospitals selected as a probability sample of all U.S. hospitals with 24-hour EDs and at least 6 inpatient beds. Each participating NEISS hospital is hand-selected by CPSC because it provides an important representation of all other hospitals of its size and unique characteristics in the U.S.

__2. Source (Sales Data): [USA Trade Census](https://usatrade.census.gov/)__

Sales and Trade data each state regarding fireworks.  Reports data range from 2016 to April 2021.
